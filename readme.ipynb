    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements an Information Retrieval System with a web crawler and a search engine. The system is designed to crawl web pages, index their content, and provide search functionalities using ranking algorithms such as TF-IDF, PageRank, and BM25.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Web Crawler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TitleCrawler Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:** The `TitleCrawler` class is initialized with a starting URL and a maximum number of links to crawl.\n",
    "- **Crawling:** The `crawl` method retrieves content from a web page, extracts the title and text, and updates the positional index.\n",
    "- **Indexing:** The `update_positional_index` method extracts terms and synonyms from the title/content and updates the positional index.\n",
    "- **Details Retrieval:** The `retrieve_crawler_details` method retrieves details about the last crawled page.\n",
    "- **Start Crawl:** The `start` method initiates the crawling process and returns details about the crawled pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Search Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SearchEngine Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:** The `SearchEngine` class is initialized with lists of documents and an empty positional index.\n",
    "- **Indexing Documents:** The `index_documents` method processes documents and constructs the positional index.\n",
    "- **TF-IDF Search:** The `tf_idf_search` method performs a TF-IDF search based on a given query.\n",
    "- **BM25 Search:** The `bm25_search` method performs a BM25 search based on a given query.\n",
    "- **PageRank Calculation:** The `calculate_page_rank` method calculates PageRank scores for documents.\n",
    "- **PageRank Search:** The `page_rank_search` method performs a search using PageRank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. PageRankCalculator Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `PageRankCalculator` class is used internally by the `SearchEngine` class to calculate PageRank scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. GUI Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the `customtkinter` library for interacting with the web crawler and search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Crawling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Initialize the `TitleCrawler` with a starting URL and the maximum number of links.\n",
    "   - Click the \"Crawl\" button to initiate the crawling process.\n",
    "2. **Search Engine:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Enter a search query in the designated text area.\n",
    "   - Select the ranking algorithm (TF-IDF, PageRank, BM25) using the radio buttons.\n",
    "   - Click the \"Search\" button to retrieve search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code relies on external libraries, including `nltk`, `requests`, `bs4` (Beautiful Soup), `numpy`, `networkx`, and `customtkinter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- The positional index is written to a file named `positional_index.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crawling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Provide a starting URL and the maximum number of links.\n",
    "   - Click \"Crawl\" to retrieve details about the crawled pages.\n",
    "2. **Searching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Enter a search query in the designated area.\n",
    "   - Choose a ranking algorithm (TF-IDF, PageRank, BM25).\n",
    "   - Click \"Search\" to see the results.\n",
    "3. **Positional Index:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The positional index is saved to the `positional_index.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed before running the code."
